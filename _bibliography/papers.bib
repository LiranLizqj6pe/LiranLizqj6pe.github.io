  abstract     = {This paper reviews the Brouwer’s fixed-point theorem under the lens of constructive mathematics. Specifically, it presents a proof for the following statement: there is no analog of Brouwer’s fixed-point theorem in one-dimension in constructive mathematics. The paper starts by introducing some basic concepts of constructive mathematics and the Brouwer’s fixed-point theorem in classical topology. It then gives a counterexample to Brouwer’s fixed-point theorem on the interval [0,1] with idea that there exists a non-extendable computable function in constructive mathematics. The result of this work provides further insights on the characteristics of constructive mathematics.  },
