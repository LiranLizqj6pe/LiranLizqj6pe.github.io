  author={Einstein*†, A. and Podolsky*, B. and Rosen*, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

  abstract     = {This paper reviews the Brouwer’s fixed-point theorem under the lens of constructive mathematics. Specifically, it presents a proof for the following statement: there is no analog of Brouwer’s fixed-point theorem in one-dimension in constructive mathematics. The paper starts by introducing some basic concepts of constructive mathematics and the Brouwer’s fixed-point theorem in classical topology. It then gives a counterexample to Brouwer’s fixed-point theorem on the interval [0,1] with idea that there exists a non-extendable computable function in constructive mathematics. The result of this work provides further insights on the characteristics of constructive mathematics.  },
