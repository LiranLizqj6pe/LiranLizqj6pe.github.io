My name is Liran Li (simplified Chinese: 李[Li] 栎然[Liran]), but you can also call me Stephen. I'm double majoring in Theoretical Mathematics and Computer Science at the University of Virginia. My main reseach interests are Geometric Group Theory and Cryptography. I study the word problem for groups, representation theory, oblivious data structures and algorithms, public key crypto systems, and automata theory.

I was born and raised in [Nanjing city (simplified Chinese: 南京)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanjing), People's Republic of China.
