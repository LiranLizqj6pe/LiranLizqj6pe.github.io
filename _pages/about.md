My name is Liran Li (simplified Chinese: 李[Li] 栎然[Liran]), but you can also call me Stephen. I’m an incoming MSCS student at the [School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/). My primary research interest lies in the mathematical foundations of cryptography, especially at the intersection of cryptography and geometric group theory. I also explore broader topics in theoretical computer science, cryptography, quantum computing, and computational algebraic topology. My detailed CV can be obtained [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lSIePwUWZx8URXpBVriBEfhiGSKJoIQj/view?usp=sharing).

I was born and raised in [Nanjing city (simplified Chinese: 南京)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanjing), People's Republic of China.
